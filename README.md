# Speech_Emotion_Recognition
After many considerations of previous works of SERâ€™s, we find that it is easy to generate emotion using Deep learning techniques. There are many ways in Deep learning to extract the emotions from speech. Deep learning uses neural networks to process the given data. This helps us to find the results a way faster than others.
In our application we had used a technique of Deep learning called LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory).
Here, We have calculated the emotion of a person by considering the way they talk.
